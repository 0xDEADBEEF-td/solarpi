#cloud-config

# This is the user-data configuration file for cloud-init. By default this sets
# up an initial user called "ubuntu" with password "ubuntu", which must be
# changed at first login. However, many additional actions can be initiated on
# first boot from this file. The cloud-init documentation has more details:
#
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/
#
# Some additional examples are provided in comments below the default
# configuration.

# Set ubuntu and root user to user-desired password and do not expire
chpasswd:
  expire: false
  list:
  - ubuntu:default
  - root:default

# Enable password authentication with the SSH daemon
ssh_pwauth: true

## Write arbitrary files to the file-system (including binaries!)
